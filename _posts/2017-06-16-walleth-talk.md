title: First public WALLΞTH talk
---

I gave my first talk about WALLΞTH in the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Berlin-Ethereum-Meetup/events/239998378">Ethereum office Berlin yesterday</a>. It turned out great and I got a lot of nice Feedback. Thanks! You can find <a href="/assets/slides/walleth_talk_15_06_2017.pdf">my slides here</a>. That said: if you did not attend you should wait for the recordings. My slides usually contain as little text as possible and a lot of stuff will make no sense without the context of audio/video. But for the ones who have been there it can give you some links and details.

The recordings will be available a bit later. [Ryan Taylor](https://twitter.com/AdjyLeak) who chipped in the camera for the night had to fly out of town short after the event - but he said he will take good care of the SD-Card and make backups. As soon as I have the videos I will upload them and make another post.
To give you something to watch until then - this is a talk from the great <a href="https://twitter.com/chethaase">Chet Haase</a> from the Android UI-Toolkit team about giving talks. This talk inspired the style of my presentation yesterday:
