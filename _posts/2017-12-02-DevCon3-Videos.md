The [Ethereum Foundation has released the DevCon3 Videos](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/11/26/devcon3-vids-available-now). This also means the WALLETH videos are now available. Especially interesting for the one from the Breakout session as this was not streamed and so the video vas not available through the full-stream dump before.

This talks looks a bit under the hood of WALLETH. I talk about the reasons for using Kotlin and creating the [KEthereum library](https://github.com/walleth/kethereum). Also a bit on [issuETH](https://github.com/issuETH/issuETH) and other things. This talk was planned to be a bit longer - hence called "deep dive" but there was some fuckup in the schedule so it was more a bit snorkeling in the end. Still fun I think and I could bring some points that I wanted to make across and got good feedback.

Also the talk from the main-stage is now available as a separate video:
