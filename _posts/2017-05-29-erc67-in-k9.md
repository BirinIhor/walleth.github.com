title: ERC-67 in K-9 Mail
---

To bring usability to Ethereum on Android we not only need to work on applications like WALLETH - we also need to work on the infrastructure. One important pillar is [ERC-67](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/67). Today I opened [a PullRequest for K-9Mail](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/pull/2556) to support ERC-67 and cketti was really fast with the merge:

So the next version will have support for "ethereum:" URIs. But we need this for more places - e.g. [twidere](https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android) could really use it. Currently I always have to copy and paste when rinkeby test ether is requested on twitter ;-)
And copy and paste is [dangerous with addresses](https://github.com/walleth/walleth/issues/14) - It is OK for test-ether - but for real ether I would hesitate
