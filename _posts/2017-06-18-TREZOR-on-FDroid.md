title: TREZOR now on FDroid
---

The TREZOR Manager [is now on FDroid!](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=trezor&fdid=io.trezor.app) I pushed this in the process of implementing TREZOR Support for WALLETH (as [hinted here](/2017/06/12/offline-transactions/)) by creating some [PullRequests](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-android/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aligi+is%3Aclosed) and [issues](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Aligi+is%3Aclosed):

Also WALLETH on FDroid is now coming closer as [#275](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/275) is merged and [#2329](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests/2329) is opened ;-)
If you want to get a TREZOR - it would be nice to use [this link](https://trezor.io/?a=walleth.org)
