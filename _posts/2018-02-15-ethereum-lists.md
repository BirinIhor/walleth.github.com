WallETH was using token-definitions from [MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists). Unfortunately after the split of MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet it looks like this is no longer a good option as e.g. taylor who did most of the managing/merging there before has [no longer permission](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/issues/432) to do so. And you already see [PRs pile up there](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/pulls).

This is very unfortunate - but also a chance. I already had some ideas on how to improve things there
([#347](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/issues/347),
[#316](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/issues/316), [#186](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/issues/186))

So when taylor suggested to open a new repo to solve this problem: I embraced the idea and opened a new github organisation called [ethereum lists](https://github.com/ethereum-lists) and already implemented the split and merging scripts discussed in [#347](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/issues/347).

So please PR your tokens, addresses and other data you have to contribute. Also happy about other projects using this data!
