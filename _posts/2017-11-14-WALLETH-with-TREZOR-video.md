[David Albrecht](https://github.com/davalb) made a nice video on how to use WALLETH+TREZOR - this is part 1 of a 2 part video series rooted in this [issuETH](http://walleth.org/2017/10/18/issuETH-ethereum-issue-bounties) backed issue: [https://github.com/walleth/media/issues/1](https://github.com/walleth/media/issues/1)

I opened a lot of bounties - but this was the only one where I put real ether in. Seems this motivates people more - so I should do it on some more issues. Or perhaps you want to put some on the issues you want to have implemented ..-)
