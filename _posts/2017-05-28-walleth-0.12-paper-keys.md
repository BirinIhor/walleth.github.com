title: WALLΞTH 0.12 - keys on paper
---

WALLΞTH 0.12 is all about keys on paper. On devices with Android KitKat and above you can now print your private key when exporting. You can also use this feature to "print to PDF":

Also you can now import ECDSA keys as e.g. [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com) is using on their paper wallets:

As always feedback is very welcome. And a big thanks again to [karalabe](https://github.com/karalabe) for [implementing](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14502) the [proposed change to the API](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14481) so quickly. Also thanks for the Ethereum Foundation for all their work and [mentioning WALLETH in the blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/05/24/roundup-round-iii/).
